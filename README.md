Description:
    User lookup utility. Mostly useful if you managing over 100+ server and
    wants to quickly verify a user account.  Useful for doing account
    maintenance for user deletion/modification/password change.

    finduser.sh will check for a text file called 'servers' for a list of
    servers it will connect to.  For convenience, setup ssh passwordless login
    on all the servers before running the finduser.sh script.
